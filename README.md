# How To: Getting started in Hyperledger Composer and Fabric

The purpose of this repository is to get you started working on Hyperledger Fabric framework which is an all- purpose permissinoes blockchain where you can desing a business logic, code smart contracts, build and deploy a network that will follow the business logic. Composer is a tool for rapid prototyping that allows you tom build proof of concept ob the business network and that can be deployed and tested on an online playground, locally or on a server. Composer is ment to be a tool for testing and addoption but it is recomended tha in development to work directly on Fabric.

This How To will guide you to the documentation and tutorials of both Fabric and Composer and propose some exercises to get you started. It is based on the work we have been doing on [Blockchain for Open Science](http://blockchain4openscience.com/) and the [git repo](https://github.com/Blockchain4openscience) and a number of side projects that we have worked on over the last two years.

## Material

In this repo you can find three presentations that I prepared for a tutorial I gave on Blockchain at the [Biohackaton in Paris in November 2018].(https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon/tree/master/interoperability/Using%20blockchain%20in%20biomedical%20provenance%20the%20identifiers%20use%20case)
This is a good stating point for our main project which is the scholarly wallet, the other presentations are a summary of the Fabric framework and the Composer tool.

## Composer

The best place to get started is to look at the [oficial documentation](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/) 

1. First use the online tutorial, the [Composer-Playground](https://composer-playground.mybluemix.net/) and follow a couple of examples: my-basic-sample or deploy some of the other samples like the marble or bond network.
The playground will give you the understanding og the elements that make up a business model, for example the participants, the assets and the transactions. Understand the business model and the business logic of the transactions that are coded using JS. 
2. You can complement your undertanding of the examples with the presentation [Introduction to Composer]() or go directly to the [Playground Tutorial](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/tutorials/playground-tutorial)

## Fabric

After you play around with the on-line tutorial you might want to perform a local installation of the development enviorment. Currently you have the official documentation that is supporting [version 1.2](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/installing/development-tools.html) and [version 1.4](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/getting_started.html) (latest and first long term support release). 

1. Follow the installation instructions, this includes the [pre-requisites](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/installing/installing-prereqs)
2. Once intallation is complete you can start a basic network locally
